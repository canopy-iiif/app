# About

Using a single [IIIF Presentation Collection](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#overview-collection) as a data source, Canopy IIIF (Canopy) generates a browseable, searchable, customizable, and contextually-driven static site using Next.js without duplicating content.

## Use Cases

Canopy _“makes easy”_ the creation of digital exhibits for libraries, archives, and museums by providing user-experience focused components that bring IIIF resources to life. For digital humanists and scholars, Canopy provides a straightforward method to curate works from multiple sources and provide additional perspectives and aboutness beyond the included descriptive metadata. The decentralized, interoperable, and linked-data attributes of the IIIF APIs empower Canopy to provide smaller institutions with a streamlined front-end platform, neatly sidestepping the monolithic complexities often associated with conventional digital asset management systems.

## Features

- **easy [Markdown authoring](/about/example)** for scholarly content
- static page generation for each Manifest in a Collection
- customizable **full-text search** index using FlexSearch
- automatically generated facets based on Manifest metadata
- reusable components based on IIIF content

## Colophon

Canopy IIIF was created by Mat Jordan (Northwestern University) and Mark Baggett (Texas A&M University) as means to build exhibit style digital humanities projects that extend existing digital collections using IIIF Collections and Manifests. The project name "Canopy" is inspired by the presentation, [A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure](https://www.cni.org/topics/standards/a-trees-strength-is-its-trunk-iiif-as-central-operational-infrastructure), delivered by M.A. Matienzo (UC Berkeley) and Esmé Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting.

Canopy IIIF uses [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) index for text search, [IIIF Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) delivering resource content, [Markdown as MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for content, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from [IIIF Commons](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons) and [Samvera](https://samvera.org/) supporting presentation and resource delivery.
