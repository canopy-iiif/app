# Internationalization (i18n)

Canopy ships with a single English locale, but projects often need multiple languages for configuration, navigation, and content. Internationalization (i18n) is implemented entirely through configuration and the `content/` tree so you can opt in without modifying Canopy’s core runtime.

The sample project includes Spanish (`/content/es`) files to demonstrate these steps alongside the English default, plus locale YAML examples so the built-in header toggle has real copy to render.
