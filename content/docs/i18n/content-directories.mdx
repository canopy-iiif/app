# Content directories per locale

Localization is file-system driven. The base `content/` directory represents the default locale, while `content/<lang>/` directories hold localized overrides.

```
content/
  index.mdx              # default locale
  locale.yml             # default UI strings
  navigation.yml         # default navigation
  es/
    index.mdx           # localized homepage
    about/index.mdx     # localized about page
    locale.yml          # Spanish UI strings
    navigation.yml      # Spanish navigation
```

Rules:

- Mirror the same directory + filename that exists in the default locale. Example: `content/about/index.mdx` → `content/es/about/index.mdx`.
- Localized pages can include a `locale` frontmatter key for clarity, but the directory name drives routing.
- When a localized file is missing, the default locale is rendered instead.
- Create `content/<lang>/navigation.yml` and `content/<lang>/locale.yml` to override navigation + UI strings. If a file is missing, the default variant is used.

This approach keeps i18n logic out of Canopy’s core build while giving authors complete control over which pages need translations.
