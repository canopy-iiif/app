# Configure locales in `canopy.yml`

Add a `locales` array to declare every language your project supports. Each entry includes:

- `lang`: BCP 47 language tag such as `en`, `es-MX`, or `pt-BR`.
- `label`: Friendly name used in toggles or navigation.
- `default`: Optional boolean to mark the language Canopy should serve when no locale is specified.

```yaml filename="canopy.yml"
title: Site title
locales:
  - lang: en
    label: English
    default: true
  - lang: es
    label: Español
```

Guidelines:

- Provide at least one locale. When `default` is omitted, the first locale is treated as the default language.
- English (`en`) is optional—remove it entirely when another language should serve as the primary locale.
- Keep this block close to the top of `canopy.yml` so automation and docs can detect it quickly.

The builder will eventually use this data to set `<html lang>` attributes, prefix localized routes, and hydrate language toggles. For now, it drives documentation, navigation examples, and helper tooling.
