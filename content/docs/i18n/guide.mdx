# Internationalization setup guide

Follow the steps below to layer multiple languages onto a Canopy project without modifying the core builder.

1. **Add locales to `canopy.yml`.** Provide every language with `lang`, `label`, and `default`. Example shown in [Configure locales](./canopy-config).
2. **Duplicate content into language folders.** The default locale stays at `content/`. For each additional language, create `content/<lang>/` and copy the pages that need translation. Details live in [Content directories per locale](./content-directories).
3. **Create locale-specific YAML.** Add `content/<lang>/locale.yml` and (optionally) `content/<lang>/navigation.yml` so navigation and UI copy match the translated pages. See [`locale.yml` files](./locale-files).
4. **Implement a toggle.** Pass `languageToggle` data to `<CanopyHeader />` so the built-in switch renders automatically. Canopy already reads `canopy.yml → locales` and merges `content/locale.yml` overrides; reference [Build a language toggle](./language-toggle) for the prop shape.
5. **Document your decisions.** Add notes to `content/docs/i18n/` (or your own docs) explaining which pages are localized, how to extend translations, and who maintains each language.

The repository now includes `content/es/` to illustrate the pattern. Use these files as fixtures when building automation and tests for future i18n features.
