# Updating Canopy

Occasionally, new versions of Canopy are released with bug fixes, new features, and improvements. To update your Canopy installation to the latest version, you can use `npm`. Run the following command in the root of your Canopy project directory:

## Updating via GitHub Actions

If your project was created from the official Canopy template, you can also update `@canopy-iiif/app` without touching your local environment by running the **Update Canopy App** workflow in GitHub Actions.

**Note:** You may need to make sure your repository allows workflows to be run manually. Check **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** and ensure that "Read and write permissions" is selected.

1. Open your repository in GitHub, go to **Actions**, and select **Update Canopy App** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Run workflow**. You can optionally provide a specific version (for example `1.0.2`); leave it blank to install the latest release.
3. The workflow installs the requested version and opens a pull request with the updated `package.json` / `package-lock.json`.
4. After a few minutes, you should see the pull request appear in your repository.
5. Review the pull request and merge when you are ready.

This keeps Canopy dependencies current while giving you the chance to audit changes before deploying.

## Updating in your local environment

If you have a local development environment set up, you can update `@canopy-iiif/app` by running the command below. The current latest version of <CanopyVersion/> will be installed:

```sh
npm i @canopy-iiif/app@latest @samvera/clover-iiif@latest
```
