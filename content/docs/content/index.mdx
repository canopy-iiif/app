# Content

Create contextual stories under `content/` using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) — Markdown with embedded components. Every file becomes a page during the build and can pull in IIIF resources, sliders, and cards.

See the [Creating Markdown Content guide](/create-markdown-content) for a full walkthrough.

## Authoring basics

- Store `.mdx` files under `content/`. Nested directories become URL paths.
- Start each file with optional YAML front matter to set titles, metadata, and referenced manifests.
- Write Markdown as usual, then drop components such as `<Viewer />` or `<ReferencedItems />` wherever you need them.

### Example

```mdx filename="content/about/nez-perce.mdx"
---
title: The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)
navigation: about
referencedManifests:
