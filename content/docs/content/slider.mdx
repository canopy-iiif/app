# Slider

`<Slider>` renders a horizontally scrolling carousel using Clover’s slider component. Point it at a IIIF Collection (facet output, curated set, etc.) and each manifest becomes a card that links back to its work page.

## Props

| Prop          | Type   | Required | Notes                                                      |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `iiifContent` | string | ✅       | IIIF Collection URL. Local `/api/facet/...` paths also work. |
| `height`      | string |          | Optional height for the viewer region.                     |
| `options`     | object |          | Passed through to Clover’s slider implementation.          |

The slider does not load manifests from front matter; always provide an explicit collection URL. When you point it at a Canopy-generated facet (`/api/facet/<label>/<value>.json`), the cards automatically link back to `/works/<slug>.html`.

```mdx
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/creator/david-alfaro-siqueiros.json" />
