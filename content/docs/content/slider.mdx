# Slider

`<Slider>` renders a horizontally scrolling carousel using Clover’s slider component. Point it at a IIIF Collection (facet output, curated set, etc.) and each manifest becomes a card that links back to its work page.

## Props

| Prop          | Type   | Required | Notes                                                      |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `iiifContent` | string | ✅       | IIIF Collection URL. Local `/api/facet/...` paths also work. |
| `height`      | string |          | Optional height for the viewer region.                     |
| `options`     | object |          | Passed through to Clover’s slider implementation.          |

The slider does not load manifests from front matter; always provide an explicit collection URL. When you point it at a Canopy-generated facet (`/api/facet/<label>/<value>.json`), the cards automatically link back to `/works/<slug>.html`.

```mdx
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/creator/david-alfaro-siqueiros.json" />
```

### Custom breakpoints

Pass Clover’s `options.breakpoints` map to change how many cards are shown per viewport width. Any configuration supported by the [Clover Slider docs](https://clover-iiif.dev/docs/slider#options) works the same in Canopy because we forward the `options` object directly to Clover.

```jsx copy
const MyCustomSlider = () => {
  const iiifContent =
    'https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/c373ecd2-2c45-45f2-9f9e-52dc244870bd?as=iiif';

  const customBreakpoints = {
    320: {
      slidesPerView: 2,
      spaceBetween: 20,
    },
    480: {
      slidesPerView: 3,
      spaceBetween: 30,
    },
    640: {
      slidesPerView: 4,
      spaceBetween: 40,
    },
  };

  return (
    <Slider
      iiifContent={iiifContent}
      options={{
        breakpoints: customBreakpoints,
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

> Tip: Set project-wide defaults (used by `<Slider />`, homepage sliders, and `<RelatedItems />`)
> in `packages/app/ui/src/iiif/sliderOptions.js`. Use the exported `rem()` helper when defining
> `spaceBetween` so the slider bundle can convert to pixels with
> `window.getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)`.

For example, to space cards with `1.25rem` gutters whenever the viewport is 640px or wider:

```js
export const sliderOptions = {
  breakpoints: {
    640: {
      slidesPerView: 3,
      spaceBetween: rem(1.25),
    },
  },
};
```

The `rem()` helper keeps the config serializable during SSR and converts to pixels client-side once
the slider runtime has access to `window`.
