# Markdown

Every page in `content/` is an `.mdx` file: Markdown plus JSX components. The quickest way to see everything in action is to open `content/about/markdown.mdx`, which contains headings, quotes, lists, tables, images, and footnotes. This guide recreates those patterns in smaller chunks.

## File layout

- Nested folders map to URL paths (`content/guides/index.mdx` → `/guides/`).
- `index.mdx` inside any directory becomes that directory’s landing page.
- Run `npm run dev` to preview changes with live reload.

## Supported front matter

Add YAML at the top of each file to set metadata and opt into search or reference features. These are the keys Canopy reads today—older fields like `image` are ignored and can be deleted.

| Key                                       | Purpose                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`                                   | Page title used for `<h1>` and `<title>`.                                   |
| `description`                             | Optional blurb for `<meta name="description">`.                             |
| `referencedManifests`                     | List of manifest URLs consumed by `<ReferencedItems />` / `<References />`. |
| `search`                                  | When set to `false`, removes the page from the search index.                |
| `searchType`                              | Overrides the record type (e.g., `docs`).                                   |
| `searchSummary` / `searchSummaryMarkdown` | Custom blurb shown in search results.                                       |

Example:

```mdx
---
title: January 1955 Correspondence
description: Seven letters between Amanda Ira Aldridge and Mihailo Kovačević
referencedManifests:
  - https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/46de2c91-3a29-4525-939e-ee17073f3a7e?as=iiif
  - https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/bb968afb-7857-46bd-9392-d8617a93cc9f?as=iiif
searchSummary: Letters exchanged during January 1955.
---
```

### Home page flags

`content/index.mdx` recognizes two more keys:

- `showHero`: show the featured-manifest hero (`true`/`false`).
- `showHighlighted`: render metadata sliders beneath the hero.

```mdx
---
title: Amanda Ira Aldridge Correspondences
showHero: true
showHighlighted: true
---
```

## Core Markdown patterns

### Text, emphasis, headings

```mdx
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

Paragraphs can mix _italics_, **bold**, and `inline code` for props like `iiifContent`.
```

### Lists and blockquotes

```mdx
1. Gather manifests.
2. Draft copy.
3. Link to supporting resources.[^1]

- Highlight takeaways.
- Pair prose with citations.

> Blockquotes surface letters, diary entries, or reviewer notes.
```

### Images

```mdx
![Stacked archival boxes](https://picsum.photos/seed/canopy-stacks/800/360)

<Image
  src="https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/9013118"
  isTiledImage
  height="400px"
  alt="Detail from The Summons"
  caption="Use the Image component for pan-zoom or annotated figures."
/>
```

### Tables and definition lists

```mdx
| Feature | Syntax | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | ----- |
| Tables  | `| col | col |` | Align columns with pipes and separators. |
| Code    | ```` ```js const id = 1; ``` ```` | Add a language hint for syntax highlighting. |

Term
: Definition lists keep glossaries tidy.
```

### Code blocks and checklists

````mdx
```txt filename="snippet.mdx"
<Viewer iiifContent="https://…" />
```

- [x] Document the build inputs.
- [ ] Leave one unchecked item as a reminder.
````

### Footnotes

```mdx
Refer to prior research when needed.[^source]

[^source]: Footnotes collect citations at the end of the page.
```

## Components inside Markdown

Embed Canopy components inline to tie Markdown narratives back to IIIF assets:

- `<Viewer />` for a full manifest experience.
- `<Image />` for single-canvas figures.
- `<Slider />` for curated carousels.
- `<ReferencedItems />` / `<References />` to connect essays and works.

Because MDX is just React, you can pass props directly in the markup. Keep component usage minimal when possible so the prose stays readable in raw form.

[^1]: Footnotes defined later in the file display at the bottom of the rendered page.
