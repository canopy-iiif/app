# Navigation

Configure top-level links in `content/navigation.yml`. The file contains a `navigation` array with `href`/`label` pairs
that render in the header on every page:

```yaml filename="content/navigation.yml"
navigation:
  - href: /search
    label: Works
  - href: /docs
    label: Docs
  - href: /about
    label: About
```

For older releases of Canopy and other advanced use cases, you can still pass a `navigation` prop directly to
`<CanopyHeader />`, which takes precedence over `navigation.yml`.

```mdx filename="content/_app.mdx"
<CanopyHeader
  title="Art & Empire"
  navigation={[
    {href: "/search", label: "Items"},
    {href: "/essays", label: "Essays"},
    {href: "/about", label: "About"},
  ]}
/>
```

## Section navigation

Sectional navigation, like what you see in these docs (Configuration, Components, etc...), is handled automatically by a `<Layout>` wrapper in `_layout.mdx` files that read the file system structure under `content/`. Every section can have its own sidebar menu built from the MDX files it contains. Read more about layout configuration in the **[Layout](/docs/content/layout)** guide.

```sh {3,7}
content/
├── essays/
│   ├── _layout.mdx
│   ├── empirical-research.mdx
│   └── index.mdx
└── about/
    ├── _layout.mdx
    └── index.mdx
```
