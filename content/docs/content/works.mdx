# Works

Every manifest discovered in your configured IIIF collections becomes a static page at
`/works/<slug>.html`. Slugs are generated from the manifest label; when duplicates appear we append a
short hash to keep routes unique.

## Page structure

1. **Hero + Viewer** — `<Viewer>` renders the IIIF manifest via Clover. It hydrates in the browser
   but exposes a placeholder server-side so SSR stays safe.
2. **Metadata** — The manifest `label`, `summary`, `metadata`, and `requiredStatement` are rendered as
   description lists. Metadata labels that match entries in `canopy.yml → metadata` gain facet links
   to `/search` pre-filtered by that label/value.
3. **References** — `<References />` shows Markdown pages that cite the work via the
   `referencedManifests` front matter field. This creates a two-way link between essays and works
   automatically.
4. **Related sliders** — `<RelatedItems />` renders per-facet sliders driven by the metadata labels in
   your configuration. On work pages it matches the manifest’s metadata first, so each slider shows a
   relevant value.

## Customising the layout

Edit `content/works/_layout.mdx` to change headings, rearrange sections, or slot in new components.
The layout receives the manifest via `props.manifest`, so you can read normalized Presentation 3 data
and pass it into your own UI.

```mdx filename="content/works/_layout.mdx"
---
layout: works
---

<section className="space-y-10">
  <header>
    <h1>{props.manifest.label?.none?.[0]}</h1>
    <p>{props.manifest.summary?.none?.[0]}</p>
  </header>

  <Viewer iiifContent={props.manifest.id} />

  <section>
    <h2>Metadata</h2>
    <Metadata manifest={props.manifest} />
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Contextual references</h2>
    <References emptyLabel="Essays will appear here when they cite this work." />
  </section>

  <RelatedItems top={3} />
</section>
```

`<Metadata />` is the default component shipped in the starter; replace it or wrap it if you need a
custom presentation (e.g., grouping fields, hiding empty entries, or translating labels). Any UI you
import from `@canopy-iiif/app/ui/server` is SSR-safe.

## Viewer options

`<Viewer>` accepts the same props described in the [Viewer component docs](/docs/components/viewer).
Common tweaks include `options={{ showDownload: true }}` or background adjustments. Avoid disabling
pan/zoom controls unless there is a clear user need.

## Required statements and rights

Required statements and attribution fields from the manifest appear in the metadata block by default.
If your institution needs to surface additional license or rights links, extend the layout and append
custom sections after `<Metadata />`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing pages** — confirm that the manifest is reachable from one of the configured collections
  and that the build log lists it under “Writing work pages”.
- **Broken viewer** — run `npm run dev` and inspect the browser console; hydration errors usually
  point to missing React globals. The starter injects them in `site/scripts/react-globals.js`, so
  ensure that script loads on custom layouts.
- **Metadata facets not linking** — make sure the label is listed verbatim (case-sensitive) under the
  `metadata` array in `canopy.yml`.
