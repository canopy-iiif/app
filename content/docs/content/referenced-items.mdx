<ReferencedItems />
```

## References Component

On individual work pages you can surface the contextual essays that cited the item using `<References />`. When this
component is rendered inside `content/works/_layout.mdx` it automatically picks up the current manifest id from the page
context. You can also point it at another manifest explicitly by passing `id`.

```mdx copy {11-13}
<Container>
  <h2>Contextual References</h2>
  <References emptyLabel="This work has not been referenced yet." />
</Container>

<References
  id="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/46de2c91-3a29-4525-939e-ee17073f3a7e?as=iiif"
  title="Referenced in these essays"
  emptyLabel="No matches yet."
/>
```

The component renders a definition list so it inherits the standard metadata styling on work pages. Override the `title`
prop to change the `<dt>` label (defaults to “Referenced by”), and the optional `emptyLabel` to customize the fallback
text.
