# ReferencedItems

`<ReferencedItems />` renders a responsive grid of cards for every manifest listed in the page’s `referencedManifests` front matter. Use it at the end of an essay to cite the works you pulled from the collection. Pair it with [`<References />`](./references) to surface backlinks on work pages.

## How it works

1. Add `referencedManifests` to the page front matter (see [Markdown](./markdown#front-matter)).
2. Drop `<ReferencedItems />` anywhere in the body. The component reads the front matter via the page context and loads each manifest’s thumbnail, title, and summary.

You can bypass front matter by passing an `items` prop (array of `{ href, title, thumbnail, thumbnailWidth, thumbnailHeight, summary }`).

`emptyLabel` renders a fallback message when no manifests are referenced.
