# Share and Reuse Content

Works in a Canopy IIIF site can be shared with others via [IIIF Content State](https://iiif.io/api/content-state/1.0/). This allows content to be opened to specific views and allows content to be easily reopened in other viewers.

> **Note:** The Share component follows the [IIIF Content State 1.0](https://iiif.io/api/content-state/1.0/) specification so links stay portable across viewers.

> **Prereq:** This walkthrough assumes you already have a running Canopy IIIF project ([Create a Project](/get-started)).

## Use Case

You are a digital humanist who wants to link to a specific page of a book in a social media post and point at that page in the book in custom component.

## Implementation


### Navigate to the Book and Page You Want to Share from Canopy IIIF

In your web browser, open a link to [The North American Indian](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/canopy-iiif/works/the-north-american-indian-being-a-series-of-volumes-picturing-and-describing-the-indians-of-the-unit)
and click on **page 3**. With **page 3** active, click the **Share** button and the checkbox next to **page 3**.
Clicking the checkbox signifies you want the link to open to that specific view.

### Share the Link in a Social Media Post

Using your social media platform of choice, create a new post using the link in the Share component's box. As
readers click the link, they will open the work in Canopy IIIF at the page you specified.

### Discuss the View in Custom Content Using the `Viewer` Component

Now let's create a new page within `About` with a link to the view in the `Viewer` component.
Create a new page called `content-state.mdx` at `/content/about`.

Since Canopy IIIF uses the IIIF Content State API specification for creating a portable, sharable representation
of what a user is looking at, we can copy the string following `?iiif-content=` and paste it into the value of
`iiif-content` in `Viewer` and it will load that view in an interoperable way.

```mdx filename="content/about/history.mdx" {10}

This is an example of a Content State request with the Viewer Component.

> **Why Base64?** IIIF Content State encodes JSON as Base64 so you can embed complex state in URLs. See the [encoding section](https://iiif.io/api/content-state/1.0/#6-content-state-encoding) for details.

### Add New Route to `About` Navigation

Open `/content/about/_meta.json` and add the link to your content to the array:

```
[
  {
    "path": "/about",
    "text": "About"
  },
  {
    "path": "/about/example",
    "text": "Markdown Example"
  },
  {
    "path": "/about/content-state",
    "text": "Content State Example"
  }
]
```
