# Using Canopy IIIF

Canopy renders static sites directly from IIIF **[Collections](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#51-collection)** and **[Manifests](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#52-manifest)**. These docs will walk you through the configuration options, content examples, and features available when building with Canopy. Canopy sites can be built in minutes and hosted anywhere static files can be served. The builder fetches manifests and generates layouts from Markdown files leaving you with a bundle of HTML, CSS, and basic javascript that can be deployed anywhere. All examples in this section are plain MDX so they can be copied directly into your own `content/` directory to get started.

</ButtonWrapper>

## How to use these docs

- Start with [Configuration](./configuration) to understand the `canopy.yml` settings in detail.
- Use [Guides](./guides) for task-driven walkthroughs of common use cases.
- Refer to [Content](./content) to understand how to author MDX files with IIIF assets.
- Visit [Internationalization](./i18n) when configuring multiple locales, language toggles, and translated navigation.
- Track what shipped in each semantic version on the [Releases](./releases) page.

## Collections and Manifests

A IIIF Collection is a JSON document that lists other IIIF resources, typically Manifests or other Collections. Collections can represent any grouping of IIIF Manifests, such as an archive, library, or museum's digital holdings. Each Manifest within a Collection describes a single object (like a book, artwork, or video) and includes metadata, images, and structure.
Canopy ingests one or more Collection URIs to build a project. Each Manifest listed in the Collection then becomes a page in the site with normalized metadata, thumbnails, and links.

Below is a [simple example](https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/) of a IIIF Collection containing two Manifests including paintings by the American artist Winslow Homer:

```yaml filename="collection.json" {3,9,14}
{
  "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json",
  "id": "https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/collection.json",
  "type": "Collection",
  "label": {"en": ["Simple Collection Example"]},
  "items":
    [
      {
        "id": "https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/manifest-01.json",
        "type": "Manifest",
        "label": {"en": ["The Gulf Stream"]},
      },
      {
        "id": "https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/manifest-02.json",
        "type": "Manifest",
        "label": {"en": ["Northeaster"]},
      },
    ],
}
```

A IIIF Manifest provides detailed information about a single digital object, including its metadata (like title, creator, date), the images or media associated with it, and how those images are structured (for example, pages in a book or views of an artwork). Each Manifest is also a JSON document that adheres to the IIIF Presentation API specifications.

```yaml filename="manifest-01.json"
{
  "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json",
  "id": "https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/manifest-01.json",
  "type": "Manifest",
  "label": {"en": ["The Gulf Stream"]},
  "metadata":
    [
      {
        "label": {"en": ["Artist"]},
        "value": {"en": ["Winslow Homer (1836–1910)"]},
      },
      {"label": {"en": ["Date"]}, "value": {"en": ["1899"]}},
    ],
  "items": [...],
}
```

## Configuration

Canopy works with both Presentation 3.0 API and the older Presentation 2.x. If the collection noted above were provided to Canopy, the `canopy.yml` file would reference Collection URI **`id`** which is also the URL where the collection document is hosted:

```yaml filename="canopy.yml" copy
title: Works by Winslow Homer
collection:
  - https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/collection.json
```

As this collection references two manifests, each would have its own relative page on the site:

- _/works/the-gulf-stream.html_
- _/works/northeaster.html_

In certain cases, Manifests may not be present in a Collection. You can still include these by manually adding their URIs directly to the `manifest` list in `canopy.yml`:

```yaml filename="canopy.yml" copy
title: Works by Winslow Homer
manifest:
  - https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/manifest-01.json
  - https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/manifest-02.json
```

In both cases, each page would include normalized metadata from the Manifest, thumbnails, and links to view the object in a IIIF viewer. Manifest metadata is indexed for search along with any other MDX files under `content/`. Theming offers some baseline options with the ability to supply optional CSS overrides. With a site built, you can deploy it anywhere static files can be served, such as GitHub Pages or your own web server. And best of all, Canopy handles all the heavy lifting of fetching, normalizing, and rendering IIIF resources so you can focus on building great experiences.

## Content Authoring

To extend IIIF material, Canopy supports the authoring of markdown files with a special component syntax (MDX). These additional content pages can include IIIF assets from your manifests. See the [Content](./content) section for details on how to author MDX files with IIIF resources. Below is a simple example of an MDX file that references the Gulf Stream Manifest from above and includes a viewer component to render it:

```mdx filename="content/about/warm-deadly-seas.mdx" copy
---
title: Warm and Deadly Seas
description: A look at Winslow Homer's 1899 painting The Gulf Stream.
referencedManifests:
  - https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/manifest-01.json
---

### Example: Warm and Deadly Seas

In 1899, Winslow Homer painted _The Gulf Stream_, a powerful depiction of a lone man
adrift in a small boat amidst turbulent seas. The painting captures the raw force of
nature and the vulnerability of humanity against its vastness. In this late 19th-century
work, Homer illustrates not only the physical dangers of the sea but also the existential
threats faced by individuals in an indifferent universe.

<Viewer iiifContent="https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/manifest-01.json" />
```

This page would be accessible at _/about/warm-deadly-seas.html_ and include the viewer rendering the Manifest specified. The `referencedManifests` frontmatter key ensures that any metadata from the Manifest is indexed for search on this page as well.
