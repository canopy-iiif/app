# Using Canopy IIIF

Canopy renders static sites directly from IIIF Collections. The builder fetches manifests,
derives a sitemap, writes `site/`, and leaves you with Markdown files instead of templates or a
database.

## Working with Canopy

Canopy turns the IIIF collection URIs listed in [`canopy.yml`](./configuration) into static pages.
Each manifest becomes `/works/<slug>.html` with normalized metadata, thumbnails, and links.
Manifest metadata is indexed for search and exposed as JSON under `/api/search/**`. MDX files under
`content/` are first-class: you can embed `<Viewer />`, `<Slider />`, or `<ReferencedItems />`
without reaching for separate templates. UI primitives (hero, related sliders, navigation) are
opinionated but configurable, so you focus on data and copy. The theme system is a small set of
Radix-backed tokens plus optional CSS overrides. See [Content](./content), [Features](./features),
and [Theming](./theming) for specifics.

Set up [`canopy.yml`](./configuration) with collection URIs, featured manifests, metadata facets,
and theme choices. Run `npm run dev` (with live reload) or `npm run build` to fetch IIIF data,
populate `.cache/iiif/`, and write HTML + assets into `site/`. Author or edit MDX pages under
`content/`; shared wrappers (`_app.mdx`, `_layout.mdx`) control navigation and layout.
When you’re satisfied, deploy by copying the generated `site/` directory to your host (Pages, S3,
etc.). No application server or database ships with the result.

## How to use these docs

- Start with [Configuration](./configuration) to understand the `canopy.yml` keys and environment
  variables.
- Use [Guides](./guides) for task-driven walkthroughs (populating metadata collections, writing
  markdown, mapping `navPlace`, and so on).
- Refer to [Features](./features) for the behavior of each UI primitive, including props and data
  requirements.
- Keep the [Content reference](./content) handy when embedding viewers, related items, or inline
  IIIF assets in prose.

All examples in this section are plain MDX. Copy them into your project or adapt them while keeping
the same component APIs.
