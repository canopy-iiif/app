# Using Canopy IIIF

This docs section explains how the builder ingests IIIF collections, how MDX pages fit into the
site, and which configuration values control search, theming, or featured experiences.

## What you can do here

- **Configure** core behavior with [`canopy.yml`](./configuration) — collections, featured
  manifests, search, theme, and sitemap data all live in one file.
- **Compose layouts** for docs, guides, and project sections through shared `<Layout />`
  wrappers plus `_meta.json` navigation files. See the [Layout reference](./layout).
- **Author MDX** content under `content/` with components such as `<Viewer />`, `<Slider />`, and
  `<ReferencedItems />`. The [Content reference](./content) and [guides](./guides) cover the
  available helpers.
- **Explore features** like the hero, metadata page, search, works, and related sliders in the
  [Features](./features) section.
- **Tune the theme** via a few Radix-backed tokens documented under [Theming](./theming).

These pages are plain MDX files, so copy/paste patterns directly into your project or remix them
while keeping the same component APIs.
