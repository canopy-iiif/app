# Configuration

Canopy reads settings from `canopy.yml` in the repository root. Override the path with `CANOPY_CONFIG=/path/to/file.yml`. Edit the file after walking through the [Get Started guide](/get-started).

## Quick start

```yaml filename="canopy.yml" copy
collection:
  - https://example.org/iiif/collections/a
  - https://example.org/iiif/collections/b
metadata:
  - Subject
  - Creator
featured:
  - https://example.org/iiif/manifest/alpha
  - https://example.org/iiif/manifest/bravo
```

## Basic configuration

### collection

- **Required.** Provide one URI or an array of IIIF Collection URIs.
- URIs must match the Collection `id` values.
- Override the entire list with `CANOPY_COLLECTION_URI` for scripted builds.

### metadata (facets)

- Optional list of manifest metadata labels (case-sensitive in YAML, matched case-insensitively at build time).
- Drives related sliders, metadata callouts, and `/api/facet/**` IIIF collections.
- Set it to an empty list to turn off facets without deleting the key.

### featured

- Optional list of manifest URIs for the homepage hero and other highlighted slots.
- Entries should belong to your configured collections; Canopy normalizes IDs to avoid duplicates.
