# Configuration

Canopy reads settings from `canopy.yml` in the repository root. Override the path with `CANOPY_CONFIG=/path/to/file.yml`. Edit the file after walking through the [Get Started guide](/get-started).

## Quick start

```yaml filename="canopy.yml" copy
collection:
  - https://example.org/iiif/collections/a
  - https://example.org/iiif/collections/b
metadata:
  - Subject
  - Creator
featured:
  - https://example.org/iiif/manifest/alpha
  - https://example.org/iiif/manifest/bravo
theme:
  accentColor: tomato
  grayColor: sand
  appearance: light
```

## Basic configuration

### Collections

```yaml
collection:
  - https://example.org/iiif/collections/a
  - https://example.org/iiif/collections/b
```

- **Required.** Provide one URI or an array of IIIF Collection URIs.
- URIs must match the Collection `id` values.
- Override the entire list with `CANOPY_COLLECTION_URI` for scripted builds.

### Metadata and facets

```yaml
metadata:
  - Subject
  - Creator
```

- Optional list of manifest metadata labels (case-sensitive in YAML, matched case-insensitively at build time).
- Drives related sliders, metadata callouts, and `/api/facet/**` IIIF collections.
- Set it to an empty list to turn off facets without deleting the key.

### Featured items

```yaml
featured:
  - https://example.org/iiif/manifest/alpha
  - https://example.org/iiif/manifest/bravo
```

- Optional list of manifest URIs for the homepage hero and other highlighted slots.
- Entries should belong to your configured collections; Canopy normalizes IDs to avoid duplicates.

### Theme configuration

Canopy reads a `theme` configuration to pick the accent palette, gray palette, and default appearance (light or dark mode).
The values feed a CSS variable steps used in styling so every component inherits the same colors. All color names should be referenced in lowercase. If you omit a value, Canopy falls back to `indigo` and `slate` with a `light` appearance.

See a full list of supported colors in the [Theme](/docs/theme) docs.

```yaml
theme:
  accentColor: tomato
  grayColor: sand
  appearance: light
```

- `accentColor`: Styles buttons, links, and highlights: (e.g., `indigo`, `tomato`, `cyan`)
- `grayColor`: Sets the neutrals, foreground, and background colors: (e.g., `slate`, `sand`, `gray`)
- `appearance`: Controls dark or light mode of the site: options are `light` (default) or `dark`.
