# Features

Canopy ingests a IIIF collection and produces a full static site: home, search, works, metadata
facets, and any MDX you add under `content/`. Each section below links to deeper dives that explain
how data flows from `canopy.yml` and cached manifests into the rendered page.

## Auto-generated routes

- **[Home](./home)** — hero carousel sourced from `featured` manifests plus optional metadata
  sliders and custom MDX content from `content/index.mdx`.
- **[Search](./search)** — FlexSearch-powered, tabbed results that merge works and MDX pages, with
  templates controlled by `search.results` in `canopy.yml` and overrides in `content/search/`.
- **[Works](./works)** — one page per manifest, rendering the viewer, metadata, required statement,
  references, and related sliders.
- **[Metadata](./metadata)** — per-facet browse pages fed by the `metadata` labels you configure in
  `canopy.yml`.

## Components for custom pages

Everything in the `content/` directory is authored in MDX. Use the component docs when you need to
embed IIIF viewers, image regions, or referenced work grids alongside prose:

- [Markdown primitives](../content/markdown)
- [Card](../content/card)
- [Image](../content/image)
- [Slider](../content/slider)
- [Viewer](../content/viewer)
- [ReferencedItems](../content/referenced-items)
- [References](../content/references)
- [Search primitives](../content/search)

Pick a section above to see concrete config examples, snippets, and screenshots. The guides under
`/docs/guides` walk through multi-step workflows such as building a new collection, enriching
manifests with navPlace, and customizing the search index.
