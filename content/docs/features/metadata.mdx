# Metadata browse

Canopy builds `/metadata` automatically. It groups the metadata labels you list in `canopy.yml`
(`metadata:` array) and renders links to every unique value found across the ingested manifests. Each
link jumps directly to search results filtered to that label/value pair.

```yaml filename="canopy.yml" {5-9}
metadata:
  - Subject
  - Creator
  - Date
  - Location
```

During the IIIF build we generate `/api/facet/<label>/<value>.json` collections for those labels. The
metadata page uses the files to calculate counts and to build the links used elsewhere (home sliders,
related items, search filters).

## Page anatomy

1. **Intro copy** — `content/metadata/index.mdx` controls the opening paragraph and any contextual
   guidance you want to provide to visitors.
2. **Facet sections** — For each configured label we show the label heading and a list of values,
   ordered by descending occurrence. Each value links to `/search?type=work&label=<label>&value=<value>`.
3. **Counts** — Values display the number of works that match the label/value pair so users can gauge
   scale before clicking through.

## Editing the page

Open `content/metadata/index.mdx` to add contextual content above or below the generated list. The
page already imports the metadata listing component, so you can keep your edits focused on Markdown
copy, callouts, or links to related guides.

## Tips

- Keep facet labels short and consistent; the UI uses the label verbatim as the section heading.
- Remove labels from `canopy.yml` when you stop using them—this prevents Canopy from generating
  unused `/api/facet/**` files.
- Pair metadata browse sections with MDX essays that explain curatorial choices. Cite those works via
  `referencedManifests` so the relationship flows back to individual work pages.
