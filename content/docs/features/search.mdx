# Search

`npm run build` writes a search index under `site/api/` and bundles a React runtime that mounts
into the `<Search />` placeholder or `[data-canopy-search]`. Works (IIIF manifests) and pages (MDX
files) share a single FlexSearch store so filters and type tabs stay in sync.

## Data sources

- **Works** — every manifest pulled from `collection` URIs becomes a `type: 'work'` record with
  `id`, `title`, and `href` pointing at `/works/<slug>.html`. Metadata fields listed in
  `search.index.metadata` are flattened for indexing.
- **Pages** — MDX files contribute `type: 'page'` records when they have no front matter or when
  they explicitly set `type`. Add `search: false` to opt out. Optional `searchSummary` and
  `searchSummaryMarkdown` fields override the teaser.

`packages/app/lib/build/search-index.js` combines the records and keeps IDs stable between
`search-index.json` (FlexSearch input) and `search-records.json` (display data).

## Page composition

Create `content/search/_layout.mdx` to control the markup surrounding the runtime. The layout
receives a `search` prop with `form`, `summary`, `count`, and `results` placeholders. Drop them
anywhere in the document to change the layout without editing React code.

```mdx filename="content/search/_layout.mdx"
---
title: Search
---

<section>
  <h1>{props.title}</h1>
  {props.search.summary}
  {props.search.form}
  {props.search.count}
</section>

{props.search.results}
```

If you omit `_layout.mdx`, Canopy renders a fallback layout that stacks the form, summary, and
results vertically.

## Tabs, layouts, and templates

Control the rendered tabs and markup via `search.results` in `canopy.yml`:

```yaml filename="canopy.yml" {12-24}
search:
  results:
    work:
      layout: grid      # grid | list
      result: figure    # figure | article
    page:
      layout: list
      result: article
  tabs:
    order:
      - work
      - page
```

- `layout` switches between the masonry grid (uses `react-masonry-css`) and a stacked list.
- `result` picks the MDX partial that renders each item. Define `_result-figure.mdx` or
  `_result-article.mdx` under `content/search/` to override the defaults. Each file receives the
  record (`props.record`), the active query, and helper props for badges or metadata.
- `tabs.order` reorders tabs without redefining `layout`/`result`. Types omitted from `results`
  inherit the default `grid` + `figure` combo.

## Filtering and URL state

The runtime watches `?q` and `?type` query params, so deep links remain stable when you switch
between tabs or refine a search. When you add more record types via front matter (`searchType:
example`), include them in `search.results` and `tabs.order` to expose dedicated tabs.

## Styling hooks

- Use the `.canopy-search` class (root element) to add custom spacing or background treatments in
  `app/styles/main.css`.
- Override button or input styles globally via the Tailwind preset or your own CSS variables in
  `@theme`.
- When you need different markup for specific record types, create additional templates under
  `content/search/` and branch based on `record.type` inside the MDX.

## Debugging tips

- Inspect `site/api/search-index.json` to confirm front-matter summaries and metadata labels are
  being indexed.
- When the browser console logs `Dynamic require of 'react' is not supported`, make sure the UI
  build marks `react`, `react-dom`, `react-dom/client`, `react-masonry-css`, and `flexsearch` as
  externals (the repository is already configured this way).
- Delete `.cache/search` (if present) plus `site/api/search-*` and rebuild when you change record
  shapes.
