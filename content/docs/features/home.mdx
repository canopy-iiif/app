# Home

The landing page is rendered from `content/index.mdx`. Front matter toggles the hero and highlighted
sliders while the Markdown body gives you full control over introductory copy, calls to action, or
embedded Canopy components.

```mdx filename="content/index.mdx"
---
title: Amanda Ira Aldridge Correspondence
showHero: true
showHighlighted: true
---

<Container>
  <p>Introduce the collection, cite your institution, or drop inline media.</p>
  <ButtonWrapper>
    <Button href="/works" label="Browse works" />
    <Button href="https://example.org" label="About the project" variant="secondary" />
  </ButtonWrapper>
</Container>
```

## Hero interstitial

When `showHero` is `true` Canopy renders `<Interstitials.Hero />` at the top of the page. The hero
rotates through the `featured` manifests defined in `canopy.yml`:

```yaml filename="canopy.yml" {5-10}
collection:
  - https://collections.example.org/iiif/harpsichords
featured:
  - https://collections.example.org/iiif/manifest/alpha
  - https://collections.example.org/iiif/manifest/bravo
  - https://collections.example.org/iiif/manifest/charlie
metadata:
  - Subject
  - Creator
```

Behavior notes:

- Featured manifests are normalized during the IIIF build so duplicates collapse to a single entry.
- If you omit `featured`, Canopy falls back to a random manifest from the cached collection.
- The hero supports props like `headline`, `description`, `links`, `variant`, `background`, and
  `height`. Pass them via `content/index.mdx` (e.g., `<Interstitials.Hero headline="Explore" />`).
- Set `variant="text"` to render a text-centric hero that centers copy, trims the padding, and
  skips featured manifests entirely. The default `variant="featured"` keeps the rotating manifest
  slider.

```mdx filename="content/index.mdx" {11-16}
<Interstitials.Hero
  variant="text"
  headline="Plan your visit"
  description="Preview your favorites, bookmark upcoming tours, and read the latest from the archives."
  links={[{ title: 'Browse works', href: '/works' }]}
/>
```

## Custom content region

Everything beneath the hero comes directly from your MDX file. Compose Markdown, `<Container />`
wrappers, or IIIF components (Viewer, Slider, ReferencedItems). The docs layout wrapper automatically
provides typography defaults so you can focus on content, not scaffolding.

## Highlighted metadata sliders

When `showHighlighted` is `true`, Canopy renders `<RelatedItems />` rows driven by the metadata
labels listed in `canopy.yml`. Each slider fetches a generated `/api/facet/<label>/<value>.json`
collection and links cards back to the corresponding work page.

Tips:

- Limit the `metadata` list to fields that have a reasonable number of distinct values—each unique
  value generates its own IIIF Collection file.
- Use the `top` prop on `<RelatedItems />` to restrict the number of sliders (`top={2}` renders two
  label buckets).
- Override slider spacing with the `sliderOptions` prop or by editing
  `packages/app/ui/src/iiif/sliderOptions.js`.

## Checklist when editing the home page

- Add descriptive `title` and `description` front matter so the landing page sets the correct SEO and
  social tags.
- Keep hero copy short; the manifest label and summary already surface detailed provenance.
- Use `<Button />` for primary actions and `<Button variant="secondary" />` for tertiary links to
  maintain consistent styling.
- When you embed sliders or viewers in the Markdown body, wrap them in `<section>`/heading combos so
  the table of contents and skip links remain meaningful.
