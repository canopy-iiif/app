# Create a Timeline

Use the `<Timeline>` component to visualize events relative to one another over time. The component renders a vertical
track scaled to your supplied date range, keeping clustered events close and gaps visible. This guide walks through
building a timeline from scratch.

## 1. Add the Timeline wrapper

Start with a `<Timeline>` element. Give it a `title`, `description`, and `height` to control the scrollable viewport:

```mdx
<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  {/* Points go here */}
</Timeline>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  {/* Points go here */}
</Timeline>

## 2. Add TimelinePoints

Inside the `<Timeline>`, add a `<TimelinePoint>` for each event. Every point needs a `date` and `title`. Add a `summary`
to give readers more context:

```mdx
<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-03"
    title="Escape from slavery"
    summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-15"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray"
    summary="Marries Anna Murray in New York City."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-18"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford"
    summary="Settles in Massachusetts and adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Timeline>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-03"
    title="Escape from slavery"
    summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-15"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray"
    summary="Marries Anna Murray in New York City."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-18"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford"
    summary="Settles in Massachusetts and adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Timeline>


## 3. Highlight key events

Mark pivotal moments with the `highlight` prop. Highlighted points render in your theme's accent color:

```mdx
<TimelinePoint
  date="1838-09-03"
  title="Escape from slavery"
  summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
  highlight
/>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-03"
    title="Escape from slavery"
    summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
    highlight
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-15"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray"
    summary="Marries Anna Murray in New York City."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-18"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford"
    summary="Settles in Massachusetts and adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Timeline>

## 4. Highlight key events

Connect a point to related works in your collection with `referencedManifests`:

```mdx
<TimelinePoint
  date="1838-09-03"
  title="Escaping re-enslavement"
  summary="Following the publication of his first autobiography, Douglass spent nearly two years in the British Isles, gaining international support and legally purchasing his freedom."
  referencedManifests={[
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/20f1cd93-7851-4646-af07-0b544661569f?as=iiif"
  ]}
/>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass in 1845: Narrative, Flight, and Transatlantic Activism"
  description="Publication, increasing danger, and the beginning of Douglass’s British and Irish lecture tour."
  range={{start: "1845-06-01", end: "1845-10-31", granularity: "day"}}
  height="400px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1845-08-06"
    title="Departs the United States"
    summary="Leaves for England to avoid recapture as a fugitive and to strengthen the antislavery cause abroad."
    highlight
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1845-08-07"
    title="Sails on the Cambria"
    summary="Travels to Great Britain aboard the Cunard steamer Cambria and is forced to ride in steerage."
    referencedManifests={[
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/20f1cd93-7851-4646-af07-0b544661569f?as=iiif"
  ]}
  />
</Timeline>
