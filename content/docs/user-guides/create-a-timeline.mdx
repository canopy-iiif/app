# Create a Timeline

When creating custom content, digital scholars may want to build a timeline to accompany their narrative and visualize
events chronologically.

The `<Timeline>` component provides a vertical, time-scaled view of events, positioning them relative to one another
within a defined date range. Closely occurring events remain clustered, while larger temporal gaps are clearly
represented.

This guide walks through building a timeline from scratch using the `<Timeline>` component.

## 1. Add the Timeline wrapper

Start with a `<Timeline>` element. Give it a `title`, `description`, and `height` to control the scrollable viewport:

```mdx
<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  {/* Points go here */}
</Timeline>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  {/* Points go here */}
</Timeline>

## 2. Add TimelinePoints

Inside the `<Timeline>`, add a `<TimelinePoint>` for each event. Every point needs a `date` and `title`. Add a `summary`
to give readers more context:

```mdx
<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-03"
    title="Escape from slavery"
    summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-15"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray"
    summary="Marries Anna Murray in New York City."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-18"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford"
    summary="Settles in Massachusetts and adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Timeline>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-03"
    title="Escape from slavery"
    summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-15"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray"
    summary="Marries Anna Murray in New York City."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-18"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford"
    summary="Settles in Massachusetts and adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Timeline>


## 3. Highlight key events

Mark pivotal moments with the `highlight` prop. Highlighted points render in your theme's accent color:

```mdx
<TimelinePoint
  date="1838-09-03"
  title="Escape from slavery"
  summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
  highlight
/>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass: Escape and Early Freedom, September 1838"
  description="Douglass escaped, traveled north, and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
  height="300px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-03"
    title="Escape from slavery"
    summary="Escapes north by train and boat from Maryland."
    highlight
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-15"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray"
    summary="Marries Anna Murray in New York City."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1838-09-18"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford"
    summary="Settles in Massachusetts and adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Timeline>

## 4. Relate events to works in your collection

Connect a point to related works in your collection with `referencedManifests`:

```mdx
<TimelinePoint
  date="1838-09-03"
  title="Escaping re-enslavement"
  summary="Following the publication of his first autobiography, Douglass spent nearly two years in the British Isles, gaining international support and legally purchasing his freedom."
  referencedManifests={[
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/20f1cd93-7851-4646-af07-0b544661569f?as=iiif"
  ]}
/>
```

<Timeline
  title="Frederick Douglass in 1845: Narrative, Flight, and Transatlantic Activism"
  description="Publication, increasing danger, and the beginning of Douglass’s British and Irish lecture tour."
  range={{start: "1845-06-01", end: "1845-10-31", granularity: "day"}}
  height="400px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1845-08-06"
    title="Departs the United States"
    summary="Leaves for England to avoid recapture as a fugitive and to strengthen the antislavery cause abroad."
    highlight
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1845-08-07"
    title="Sails on the Cambria"
    summary="Travels to Great Britain aboard the Cunard steamer Cambria and is forced to ride in steerage."
    referencedManifests={[
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/20f1cd93-7851-4646-af07-0b544661569f?as=iiif"
  ]}
  />
</Timeline>

## 5. Intermix your content with a map

While the `<Timeline>` component situates events chronologically, many narratives also benefit from geographic context.
By intermixing `<Timeline>` with the `<Map>` component, events can be visualized across both time and space.

Add a `<Map>` with `<MapPoints>` that closely relate to your previous `<TimelinePoint>`s.

```mdx
<Map>
  <MapPoint
    lat="39.329"
    lng="-76.557"
    title="Escape from slavery (Sept. 3, 1838)"
    summary="Douglass departs Baltimore, traveling north by rail and water routes under constant risk of capture."
  />
  <MapPoint
    lat="40.7128"
    lng="-74.0060"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray (Sept. 15, 1838)"
    summary="Douglass marries Anna Murray in New York City, shortly after arriving as a fugitive."
  />
  <MapPoint
    lat="41.6362"
    lng="-70.9342"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford (Sept. 18, 1838)"
    summary="Douglass and Anna settle in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he begins working and soon adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Map>
```

<Map>
  <MapPoint
    lat="39.329"
    lng="-76.557"
    title="Escape from slavery (Sept. 3, 1838)"
    summary="Douglass departs Baltimore, traveling north by rail and water routes under constant risk of capture."
  />
  <MapPoint
    lat="40.7128"
    lng="-74.0060"
    title="Marriage to Anna Murray (Sept. 15, 1838)"
    summary="Douglass marries Anna Murray in New York City, shortly after arriving as a fugitive."
  />
  <MapPoint
    lat="41.6362"
    lng="-70.9342"
    title="Arrival in New Bedford (Sept. 18, 1838)"
    summary="Douglass and Anna settle in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he begins working and soon adopts the name Frederick Douglass."
  />
</Map>
