# Create Markdown Content

Implementers of Canopy IIIF can author contextual content to support Manifest resources using formatted Markdown files. These files are stored in the `/content` directory of your project. In doing so, you can add context to items in your IIIF Collection and craft a custom experience using integrated components provided by Canopy IIIF.

> **Note:** This guide assumes you already cloned or scaffolded a Canopy IIIF project. Follow [Create a Project](/get-started) first if you are starting from scratch.

## Use Case

As a digital humanist, you have authored scholarly content for distinct items in a IIIF Collection. Your aim is to publish a digital scholarship project that highlights your context alongside these items.

## Implementation


### Create a Markdown file

- In your `content` directory, find the `about` subdirectory and **create** the new file `nez-perce.mdx`.
- **Add** the following barebones Markdown and front matter to your file and save.

```mdx copy filename="content/about/nez-perce.mdx"
---
title: The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)
---

# The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)

This a sample page for scholarly content with historical context relating to the [Nez Percé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nez_Perce), also known as the Nimíipuu.
```

Your file is now accessible at the relative route `/about/nez-perce`. If running in development mode, your file is accessible at http://localhost:5001/about/nez-perce.

### Navigation updates automatically

`<Layout>` builds the About sidebar directly from the files in `content/about/`, so the new page
appears immediately. There is nothing else to configure.

### Add a IIIF Viewer

Canopy IIIF provides a [Clover IIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/) `Viewer` component that can be used to display IIIF resources within Markdown.

- **Add** a `<Viewer />` component to the bottom of our Markdown file and directly reference a [IIIF Manifest](https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif) with the `iiifContent` property.

```mdx copy filename="content/about/nez-perce.mdx"
---
title: The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)
---

# The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)

This a sample page for scholarly content with historical context relating to the [Nez Percé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nez_Perce), also known as the Nimíipuu.

## A IIIF Viewer

The `<Viewer />` is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the
IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is
responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in. These Manifests can be part of the Canopy
source Collection but are not limited to it.

<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif" />
```

The IIIF viewer is now rendered at the bottom of the page. The viewer is responsive with a max-height.

### Reference Collection Items

As a digital humanist, you might have authored a series of essays in Markdown (in the `/content` directory), in which you wish to reference or cite one or more items in the source IIIF Collection. Canopy offers an easy method for linking scholarly content to items in their collection using the `referencedManifests` front matter key. This key takes an array of IIIF Manifest URIs. The Manifests MUST be in the source IIIF Collection of the Canopy project.

- **Add** the `referencedManifests` key to the front matter with an array of Manifest URIs.
- **Add** a `<ReferencedItems />` component to bottom of our Markdown file. This will render the items as Figures in a responsive grid. Each item will have output relative local link to the item, a `thumbnail`, and the `label`.

```mdx copy filename="content/about/nez-perce.mdx"
---
title: The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)
referencedManifests:
  - https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/84aec8c1-42e8-4e2c-a6b2-1c7e3790217f?as=iiif

# The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)

This a sample page for scholarly content with historical context relating to the [Nez Percé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nez_Perce), also known as the Nimíipuu.

## A IIIF Viewer

A IIIF viewer is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the
IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is
responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in.

<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif" />

## Referenced Items

The `<ReferencedItems />` automatically outputs a grid of items that are referenced by the current page.

<ReferencedItems />
```

These references also flow back to each IIIF work page thanks to the `<References />` component that ships in the default
`content/works/_layout.mdx`. When a work is cited anywhere in the site the "Contextual References" section appears with
links to the relevant Markdown pages.

Your page should now output a grid of items that are referenced in the front matter. Automatically, a reciprocal connection is made between the Markdown content and the items in the IIIF Collection. Users can now navigate to and from the scholarly content page and the relative `/work` page representing the Manifest.

### Leveraging Metadata Collections

During the Canopy build process, new unique metadata-based IIIF Collections are automatically generated from the source IIIF Collection. These Collections can be used within Markdown content to enhance user experience and your scholarly content.

These new Collections are generated for `label` and `value` pairs defined of the `metadata` entries in a Canopy configuration file. The IIIF Collections are available at the URL pattern `/api/facet/{label}/{value}.json`. Generated IIIF Collections for these facets are logged in the Canopy build process, ex:

```sh
Creating facets as IIIF Collections...
↓ /api/facet/subject/cayuse-indians.json
↓ /api/facet/subject/chinookan-indians.json
↓ /api/facet/subject/nez-perce-indians.json
↓ /api/facet/subject/tlakluit-indians.json
↓ /api/facet/subject/umatilla-indians.json
↓ /api/facet/subject/walla-walla-indians.json
↓ /api/facet/date/1910.json
↓ /api/facet/date/1909.json
↓ /api/facet/date/1905.json
↓ /api/facet/date/1911.json
↓ /api/facet/date/1903.json
```

- **Add** a `<Viewer />` component to the bottom of our Markdown file and reference a collection for label of _Date_ and value of _1905_ with the `iiifContent` property. The `iiifContent` property URI can be either a relaltive or absolute path.

```mdx copy
<Viewer iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1905.json" />
```

![canopy content page iiif viewer for metadata collection](/examples/creating-markdown-content-referenced-item-3.png)

- Or, **Add** a `<Slider />` component as an alternative view to render a carousel of items that link to the local relative `/work` pages representing the Manifests. This component takes the same `iiifContent` property. Note that this component only supports Collection resources.

```mdx copy
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1905.json" />

Need different breakpoints? Supply Clover’s slider options directly:

```mdx copy
<Slider
  iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1905.json"
  options={{
    breakpoints: {
      320: { slidesPerView: 2, spaceBetween: 20 },
      480: { slidesPerView: 3, spaceBetween: 30 },
      640: { slidesPerView: 4, spaceBetween: 40 },
    },
  }}
/>
```

Shared defaults live in `packages/app/ui/src/iiif/sliderOptions.js`, so you can adjust project-wide
behavior there and only override `options` when a page needs something special.

Need spacing tied to `rem` units? Use the `rem()` helper exported from `sliderOptions.js` when
defining breakpoints. The slider runtime reads `window.getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)`
once and converts those values to pixels before instantiating Swiper.
```

## Referenced Items

<ReferencedItems />

## Leveraging Metadata

### Using the Viewer

The `<Viewer />` component supports IIIF Collections. This allows you to reference a IIIF Collection that is generated by Canopy IIIF. In this example, we are referencing a Collection of items that have a `date` of `1905`.

<Viewer iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1905.json" />

### Using the Slider

Alternatively, you can use the `<Slider />` component to render a carousel of items that link to the local relative `/work` pages representing the Manifests.

<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1905.json" />
```
