# Create a New Section

As your project grows, you may want to organize content into distinct sections beyond about.

Canopy generates pages from the folder structure inside `content/`. Creating a new section is as simple as adding a
folder, populating it with MDX files, and registering it in your site navigation.

This guide walks through creating a new "Essays" section from scratch.

## 1. Create the section folder

Inside the `content/` directory, create a new folder for your section. The folder name becomes the URL path:

```
content/
├── essays/          ← new section
├── docs/
├── about/
└── index.mdx
```

A folder named `essays` will be accessible at `/essays` on your site.

## 2. Add an index page

Every section needs an `index.mdx` file. This becomes the landing page when visitors navigate to `/essays`:

```mdx filename="content/essays/index.mdx"
---
title: Essays
description: Long-form writing and analysis.
---

# Essays

Explore our collection of essays on history, culture, and the archives.
```

At this point, visiting `/essays` displays your new landing page.

## 3. Add a section layout

Create a `_layout.mdx` file in your section folder. This wraps all pages in the section with consistent layout and
enables sidebar navigation:

```mdx filename="content/essays/_layout.mdx"
<Layout navigation={true} fluid={true}>
  {props.children}
</Layout>
```

## 4. Add pages to the section

Create additional MDX files in the folder. Each file becomes a page within the section:

```
content/
└── essays/
    ├── _layout.mdx
    ├── index.mdx
    ├── introduction.mdx
    └── methodology.mdx
```

```mdx filename="content/essays/introduction.mdx"
---
title: Introduction
description: An overview of our research approach.
---

# Introduction

This essay introduces the themes and questions that guide our work...
```

These pages are now accessible at `/essays/introduction` and `/essays/methodology`.

## 5. Add the section to navigation

Open `content/navigation.yml` and add an entry for your new section. The `href` should match your folder name:

```yaml filename="content/navigation.yml"
navigation:
  - href: /search
    label: Works
  - href: /essays
    label: Essays
  - href: /docs
    label: Docs
  - href: /about
    label: About
```

After rebuilding, "Essays" appears in your site header alongside the other navigation links.
