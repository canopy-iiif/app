# Navigation

Navigation is derived directly from the files under `content/`. The builder scans directories,
filters out reserved entries (names starting with `_`), and feeds the structure to `<Layout>` so you
never maintain a parallel menu schema.

## Primary navigation

Configure top-level links in `content/_app.mdx` when you render `<CanopyHeader />`. Pass a
`navigation` array with `href`/`label` pairs and the header renders them on every page:

```mdx filename="content/_app.mdx" {9-17}
<CanopyHeader
  navigation={[
    {href: "/search", label: "Works"},
    {href: "/docs", label: "Docs"},
    {href: "/about", label: "About"},
  ]}
  title="Canopy IIIF"
  logo={Logo}
/>
```

## Section navigation

When `<Layout navigation={true}>` wraps a page, it builds a sidebar from the MDX files that share the
same directory. Order follows the file path (directories first, then `index.mdx`, then remaining
files alphabetically). Nested folders become nested menus automatically. There is no front matter or
metadata file to maintain; rename a file or add a new one and the sidebar updates on the next build.

```
content/
├── docs/
│   ├── _layout.mdx
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── layout/
│       ├── index.mdx
│       └── navigation.mdx
└── about/
    └── index.mdx
```

Visiting `/docs/layout/navigation` renders the docs sidebar because the page lives under
`content/docs/layout/`. Pages outside that tree (e.g., `/about`) receive a minimalist layout unless
you wrap them in `<Layout navigation={true}>`.

## Table of contents

`<Layout>` also builds an on-page table of contents from headings inside each MDX file (levels two
and below). Keep headings short, descriptive, and unique; the generated IDs power deep links and the
right-hand toc.
