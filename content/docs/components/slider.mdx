# Slider

`<Slider>` wraps Clover’s carousel so you can stream manifests from a collection or facet feed. It hydrates client-side, stays SSR-safe, and links each slide back to its work page.

<Slider iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/7ac5769f-a1d9-4227-a350-bf8bd8b1cddc?as=iiif" />

```mdx
<Slider iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/7ac5769f-a1d9-4227-a350-bf8bd8b1cddc?as=iiif" />
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `iiifContent` | string | ✅ | IIIF Collection URL or Canopy facet JSON (`/api/facet/...`). |
| `height` | string | | CSS height for the viewport area. |
| `options` | object | | Passed to Clover and merged with global defaults from `sliderOptions.js`. |
| `className` | string | | Adds classes to the slider container. |

## Examples

### Facet feed

Point the slider at a generated facet feed to surface related manifests inline.

```mdx
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/Subject/architecture.json" />
```

### Custom breakpoints

Override the defaults with your own `options.breakpoints` map. Use the exported `rem()` helper in `sliderOptions.js` so the client runtime can convert to pixels.

```mdx
import {rem} from '@canopy-iiif/app/ui/iiif/sliderOptions';

const customOptions = {
  breakpoints: {
    320: {slidesPerView: 1.5, spaceBetween: rem(0.75)},
    640: {slidesPerView: 3, spaceBetween: rem(1)},
    1024: {slidesPerView: 4, spaceBetween: rem(1.25)},
  },
};

<Slider
  iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/94536627-cfdf-413c-852b-0cb16d986da3?as=iiif"
  options={customOptions}
/>
```

### Tall viewport

Use the `height` prop when a slider needs extra breathing room for taller thumbnails.

```mdx
<Slider
  iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/7ac5769f-a1d9-4227-a350-bf8bd8b1cddc?as=iiif"
  height="28rem"
/>
```
