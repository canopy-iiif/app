# Map

`<Map>` renders an interactive Leaflet view that plots navPlace `Point` features extracted from your IIIF manifests.

## Using IIIF navPlace

Provide any IIIF Manifest or Collection URL via `iiifContent`. When a manifest is supplied, the map plots only that record’s navPlace features. When a collection is supplied, the runtime inspects each manifest listed in the collection and includes every navPlace-enabled work it finds. Note that this currently only supports Collections whose manifests are set in your `canopy.yml` file as the build process pre-fetches and caches those records.

```mdx
<Map iiifContent="https://tamulib-dc-labs.github.io/sesquicentennial-manifests/collections.json" />
```

## Custom locations with MapPoint

Wrap `MapPoint` children inside `<Map>` to add arbitrary coordinates (including non-IIIF records). Each `MapPoint` renders alongside the navPlace markers resolved from `iiifContent`. If you omit `iiifContent`, the map only displays your custom points.

By default, custom `MapPoint` popups render their titles as plain text so visitors aren't pushed to another page. Pass an `href` prop to opt into a link. Both coordinates `lat` and `lng` are required.

```mdx {3-4}
<Map defaultZoom={12}>
  <MapPoint
    lat="26.8709"
    lng="80.9129"
    title="Lord Hastings' party entering the city of Lucknow on elephant back"
    summary="Watercolour of a procession entering Lucknow from 'Views by Seeta Ram from Cawnpore to Mohumdy Vol. IV' produced for Lord Moira, afterwards the Marquess of Hastings, by Sita Ram between 1814-15."

### Reference IIIF works from a custom point

Attach `referencedManifests` to any `MapPoint` to render a list inside the marker. This automatically resolves links to a relative local in `/works/` if available. Additionally a thumbnail is used from the referenced manifest if no `thumbnail` prop is provided.

```mdx
