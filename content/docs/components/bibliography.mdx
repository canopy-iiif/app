# Bibliography

Content authors may add footnotes anywhere in a page using standard markdown syntax. The footnotes will be collected and displayed at the bottom of the respective page automatically. `<Bibliography />` reads every Markdown file in `content/`, gathers each footnote, and prints them in one clean list. Using the component generate single source for citations on your site.

```mdx
<Bibliography />
```

<Bibliography />

## Writing footnotes

Use standard markdown [footnote](https://pandoc.org/demo/example33/8.19-footnotes.html) syntax to add citations anywhere in your content.

```mdx filename="content/about/example.mdx"
By the 1770s the East India Company controlled Bengal's revenue, reshaping trade and taxation across colonial India.[^5]

[^5]: Seema Alavi, _Company to Crown: Power and Politics in India_, 2019.
```

`<Bibliography />` groups entries by page and preserves the note numbers so readers can follow each citation back to its essay.
