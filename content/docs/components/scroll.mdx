# Scroll

`<Scroll>` is a specialized text-focused component that outputs a IIIF Manifest as a vertically oriented canvas reader. A small thumbnail or image viewer is fixed to the side of the viewport while the textual annotations scroll alongside it. `Scroll` can hand;e multiple languages and works well for digitized books, manuscripts, and other text-heavy objects. Note that that component currently only handles annotations embedded within the manifest. `Scroll` will respect the formats of `text/plain`, `text/html`, and `text/markdown`.
