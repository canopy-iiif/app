## Examples

### Static image

Use this when you have a regular JPG/PNG and want a simple pan-zoom viewer with a caption. The component handles the interaction so you only supply the URL, alt text, and optional caption.

<Image
  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/B26055943A_-_A_map_of_the_East-Indies_and_the_adjacent_countries.jpg"
  alt="1717 map by Herman Moll illustrating early European colonial reach."
  caption="1717 map by British cartographer Herman Moll, depicting the East Indies from the Persian frontier to New Guinea and southern Japan, including India, Ceylon, Southeast Asia, much of China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It shows the reach of European influence and trade during a period of expanding colonial power that would continue for several centuries."

### IIIF tiled image

Point `src` at a IIIF Image API endpoint and set `isTiledImage` so Clover fetches tiles dynamically. This keeps large images performant without pre-generating downscaled versions.

  isTiledImage
  alt="The Summons by Emanuel Leutze"
  caption="The Summons, 1856. Harvard Art Museums."
/>

  isTiledImage
  alt="The Summons by Emanuel Leutze"
  caption="The Summons, 1856. Harvard Art Museums."
/>
```

### IIIF region

Crop down to a subsection of a IIIF image by appending the `xywh` fragment to the URL. Region URLs are great for spotlighting details inside a larger canvas.

<Image

  alt="Detail from The Summons"
  caption="Masked messenger approaching a startled courtier."
/>

```mdx
<Image
  src="https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/9013118/188,650,914,712/full/0/default.jpg"
  alt="Detail from The Summons"
  caption="Masked messenger approaching a startled courtier."
/>
```

### Annotations

Pass a Clover-style `annotations` array to highlight one or more regions directly in the viewer. Each annotation object includes the source canvas, selector, and textual body so readers see structured callouts.

  isTiledImage
  alt="Annotated detail"
  caption="Annotations highlight regions inside the canvas."
  annotations={[

          },

        },

      targetIndex: 0,
    },
