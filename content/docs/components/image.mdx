# Image

`<Image>` embeds Clover’s zoomable viewer for any IIIF Image API resource or static asset. It handles deep zoom, lazy tile loading, and optional annotations without any manual wiring.

## Examples

### Static image

In many cases, you may want to provide a simple static image that do not have IIIF support or are hosted externally. Use `<Image>` for regular JPG or PNG assets as well. This example references the Wikimedia scan of Herman Moll’s 1717 East Indies map.

<Image

  alt="1717 map by Herman Moll illustrating colonial reach"
  caption="1717 map by Herman Moll depicting the East Indies from the Persian frontier to New Guinea and southern Japan."
/>

  caption="1717 map by Herman Moll depicting the East Indies from the Persian frontier to New Guinea and southern Japan."
/>
```

### Full canvas tiles

Use the base Image API endpoint with `isTiledImage` to keep very large works responsive.

  isTiledImage
  alt="Wide view of Boondi"
  caption="The full Boondi panorama renders with tile-based zoom and pan controls."
  height="520px"
/>

```mdx
<Image
  src="https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/3/138a94b0-175a-4152-98c7-df58661ce7d5"
  isTiledImage
  alt="Wide view of Boondi"
  caption="The full Boondi panorama renders with tile-based zoom and pan controls."
  height="520px"
/>
```

### Region focus

Append `xywh` fragments to zoom into a detail from the same source canvas. In this case, we draw a `3000,2800,2000,1600` rectangle around a palace below the ridge fortifications.

<Image
  src="https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/3/138a94b0-175a-4152-98c7-df58661ce7d5/3000,2800,2000,1600/max/0/default.jpg"
  alt="Palace below ridge fortifications"
  caption="Region croping highlighting hillside palace below ridge fortifications."
/>

```mdx
<Image
  src="https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/3/138a94b0-175a-4152-98c7-df58661ce7d5/3000,2800,2000,1600/max/0/default.jpg"
  alt="Palace below ridge fortifications"
  caption="Region croping highlighting hillside palace below ridge fortifications."
/>
```

We can also zoom into a more specific detail by combining `xywh` with size constraints. Here, we focus on a palace above Boondi using `950,520,7100,4740/!1200,630` to remove extraneous context.

  alt="Detail of a hillside palace above Boondi"
  caption="Detail from The town & pass of Boondi, created for Governor-General Thomas Munro."
/>

```mdx

  alt="Detail of a hillside palace above Boondi"
  caption="Detail from The town & pass of Boondi, created for Governor-General Thomas Munro."
/>
```

### Annotated callouts

We can also pass annotations to draw attention to important regions or narrative elements. In this example, an annotation highlights a group of travelers near the ridge. This retains zoom and pan functionality across the image while adding context.
