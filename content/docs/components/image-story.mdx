# ImageStory

`<ImageStory>` wraps [StoriiiesViewer](https://cogapplabs.github.io/StoriiiesViewer/api), the open-source player for Storiiies manifests created by [Cogapp](https://www.cogapp.com/). It accepts accepts IIIF Manifest URIs with annotations targeting rectangles or points on images, and renders a guided tour with built-in navigation and text areas for annotation content. The component is ideal for embedding interactive image stories in your content pages without needing to build a custom viewer from scratch.

<ImageStory manifestUrl="https://manifest.storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/v3/6c83d" />

```mdx
<ImageStory manifestUrl="https://manifest.storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/v3/6c83d" />
```

## Authoring with Storiiies Editor

Individuals of any technical skill level can easily create and export Storiiies manifests using the [Storiiies Editor](https://editor.storiiies.cogapp.com/), which provides a user-friendly interface for defining stories and contextual descriptions. Once exported, simply pass the manifest URL to `<ImageStory>` to embed the interactive experience directly in your MDX content.

Once you've created a story in the editor, click "Export" and copy the manifest URL (e.g. `https://manifest.storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/v3/6c83d`) into the `manifestUrl` prop of `<ImageStory>`. The component will handle loading the manifest and rendering the story with all its interactive features.
