# ImageStory

`<ImageStory>` wraps [Storiiies](https://www.cogapp.com/r-d/storiiies) by [Cogapp](https://www.cogapp.com/), an open-source tool for guiding users through a sequence of annotations on an image. `<ImageStory>` accepts IIIF Manifest URIs with annotations targeting rectangles or points on images, and renders them as a guided tour with built-in navigation and annotation text.

The component is ideal for embedding interactive image stories in content pages, making it easy to highlight visual details and provide contextual narratives in an engaging way. The example below is an embedded instance of https://storiiies.cogapp.com/view/3683j/Embassy-of-Hyderbeck-to-Calcutta-1800.

<ImageStory
  iiifContent="https://manifest.storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/v3/3683j"
  height="900"
/>

```mdx
<ImageStory
  iiifContent="https://manifest.storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/v3/3683j"
  height="900"
/>
```

## Authoring with Storiiies Editor

Individuals of any technical skill level can easily create and export Storiiies manifests using the [Storiiies Editor](https://editor.storiiies.cogapp.com/), which provides a user-friendly interface for defining stories and contextual descriptions. Once exported, simply pass the manifest URL to `<ImageStory>` to embed the interactive experience directly in your MDX content.

Once you've created a story in the editor, click "Export" and copy the manifest URL (e.g. `https://manifest.storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/v3/6c83d`) into the `iiifContent` prop of `<ImageStory>`. The component will handle loading the manifest and rendering the story with all its interactive features.
