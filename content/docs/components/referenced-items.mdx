# ReferencedItems

`<ReferencedItems />` reads the current page’s `referencedManifests` and renders a responsive grid of linked cards. Place it near the end of an essay to cite the works you used.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | array | | Provide custom `{href, title, thumbnail, summary}` entries instead of pulling from context. |
| `emptyLabel` | string or function | | Message rendered when no items exist; accepts a React node factory. |
| `className` | string | | Extra classes for spacing or theming. |
| `children` | node | | Optional heading or description rendered before the grid. |
| `...rest` | any | | Spread onto the wrapping `<section>`. |

## Examples

### Custom heading

Pass copy as children to add a heading that travels with the component.

<ReferencedItems>
  <h2>Works cited</h2>
  <p>Each figure links back to the full manifest page.</p>
</ReferencedItems>

```mdx
<ReferencedItems>
  <h2>Works cited</h2>

</ReferencedItems>
```

### Manual list

Bypass page context and drive the cards with your own data. This is useful for curated bibliographies that mix works and static pages.

<ReferencedItems
  items={[
    {
      href: "/works/the-town-and-pass-of-boondi-in-rajpootana.html",
      title: "The town & pass of Boondi",
      summary: "Watercolor panorama after Thomas Bacon, 1836",
      thumbnail:
        "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/4bdb5a22-6c7f-498d-8e6e-e49ea9bc4778/thumbnail",
      thumbnailWidth: 1024,
      thumbnailHeight: 768,

```

### Empty state copy

Use `emptyLabel` when you want to prompt authors to cite their sources.

<ReferencedItems emptyLabel="Add referencedManifests to show cited works." />

```mdx
<ReferencedItems emptyLabel="Add referencedManifests to show cited works." />
```
