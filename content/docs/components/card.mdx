# Card

`<Card>` renders an anchored figure with an image, title, and optional subtitle. Use it when you need a lightweight teaser that links directly to a work page or supporting essay.

## Examples

### Summary line

Add a `subtitle` when you want a brief line of context under the main title.

  title="The town & pass of Boondi"
  subtitle="Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Bacon, 1836"
/>
```

### Fixed ratio

Lock the image ratio with `imgWidth` and `imgHeight` so cards line up even when thumbnails vary.

  title="Prayer mat from the Panjab"
  subtitle="Embroidered silk, ca. 1870"
  imgWidth={1024}
  imgHeight={1536}
/>

  title="Prayer mat from the Panjab"
  subtitle="Embroidered silk, ca. 1870"
  imgWidth={1024}
  imgHeight={1536}

```

### Controlled loading

Disable lazy loading when the card sits inside an already lazy container such as `<Slider />`.
