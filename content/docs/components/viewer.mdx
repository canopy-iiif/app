# Viewer

`<Viewer>` mounts Clover’s IIIF viewer so you can embed a manifest or collection anywhere in MDX. It hydrates client-side, supports deep zoom, audio, and video, and inherits the project-wide viewer defaults.

<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif" />

```mdx
<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif" />
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `iiifContent` | string | ✅ | IIIF Manifest or Collection URL. |
| `options` | object | | Merged with Canopy’s defaults before passing into Clover. |
| `className` | string | | Adds classes to the viewer container. |
| `height` | string | | CSS height override for the viewport. |

## Examples

### Open info panel

Toggle Clover controls through the `options` prop. Here we default the information panel to the open state and surface the “About” tab.

<Viewer
  iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif"
  options={{informationPanel: {open: true, showAbout: true}}}
/>

```mdx
<Viewer
  iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif"
  options={{informationPanel: {open: true, showAbout: true}}}
/>
```

### Collection playback

Feed a collection URL to let readers page through every manifest returned by the IIIF collection.

```mdx
<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/7ac5769f-a1d9-4227-a350-bf8bd8b1cddc?as=iiif" />
```

### Tall viewport

Raise the `height` when you embed the viewer inside a stacked layout so the canvas gets more room.

```mdx
<Viewer
  iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/c26591b2-994b-4ba3-a87e-9124419fa91b?as=iiif"
  height="720px"
/>
```
