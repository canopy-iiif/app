# Timeline

`<Timeline>` renders a vertical track of `<TimelinePoint>` markers that stay in proportion to the range you supply. Each point can show a title, summary, extended description, highlight state, and related IIIF resources.

Ranges accept year-, month-, or day-level precision (`1701`, `July 1776`, or `1776-07-04`). When you provide a range the points are spaced mathematically, so clusters of events appear closer together in the scroll container. Control the viewport with the `height` prop—pass a pixel value, rem value, or percentage, and the component honors it.

## Example: Empire arc

Below is a scrolling demo that covers 1750–1900. `range` keeps each point proportional, `threshold={5}` collapses events within five years of one another, and `steps={50}` draws guide ticks every fifty years.

## Examples

### Range spacing

Give the component a range so events sit in proportion to each other. Combine `threshold` and `steps` to cluster near-duplicate years and draw guide ticks.

<Timeline
  title="Empire and Control in Colonial India"
  description="Moments of famine, conflict, and policy between 1750 and 1900."
  range={{start: "1750", end: "1900", granularity: "year"}}
  threshold={5}
  steps={50}
  height="600px"
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1770"
    title="Great Bengal Famine"
    summary="Starvation ravaged Company territory."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1781"
    title="Bengal Atlas"
    summary="Rennell mapped Bengal for Company campaigns."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1857"
    title="Great Mutiny"
    summary="Indian regiments rebelled across the north."
    highlight
  />
</Timeline>

### Referenced manifests

Provide `referencedManifests` so each point pulls teaser data from the page’s cited works.

```mdx

referencedManifests:
  - https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/7a5dd871-d0bc-4d6f-8469-1c23a872fc29?as=iiif

<Timeline>

    ]}
  />
</Timeline>
```

### Rich details

Use children to add inline prose and cite additional IIIF resources beyond the main manifest list.

<Timeline>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1857-05-10"
    title="Great Mutiny spreads"
    summary="Garrison towns erupt across North India."
    referencedManifests={[
      "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/c5a11577-a1f2-4288-95de-96ad616174ed?as=iiif",
    ]}
    iiifResources={[
      {
        href: "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/c5a11577-a1f2-4288-95de-96ad616174ed?as=iiif",
        label: "Great Mutiny, India",
      },
    ]}
  >
    <p>
      The rebellion surged across Delhi, Kanpur, and Lucknow in the first month.
    </p>
  </TimelinePoint>
</Timeline>

```mdx

    iiifResources={[

      },
    ]}
  >
    <p>
      The rebellion surged across Delhi, Kanpur, and Lucknow in the first month.
    </p>
  </TimelinePoint>
</Timeline>
```

### Pinned sides

Pass `side="left"` or `side="right"` when a point should stay on one side of the spine instead of alternating.

<Timeline>
  <TimelinePoint date="1781" title="Bengal Atlas" side="left" />
  <TimelinePoint date="1785" title="Survey depots expand" side="left" />
  <TimelinePoint date="1790" title="Company reforms" side="right" />
</Timeline>

```mdx
<Timeline>
  <TimelinePoint date="1781" title="Bengal Atlas" side="left" />
  <TimelinePoint date="1785" title="Survey depots expand" side="left" />
  <TimelinePoint date="1790" title="Company reforms" side="right" />
</Timeline>
```

### Clustered groups

Use `threshold` to group events that fall within a set number of years for the current granularity.

<Timeline
  threshold={10}
  range={{start: "1800", end: "1850", granularity: "year"}}
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1803"
    title="Capture of Delhi"
    summary="Company forces seize Delhi."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1806"
    title="Vellore uprising"
    summary="Sepoys revolt in Vellore."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1814"
    title="Gurkha War"
    summary="Gurkha forces confront the Company."
  />
</Timeline>

```mdx
<Timeline
  threshold={10}
  range={{start: "1800", end: "1850", granularity: "year"}}
>
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1803"
    title="Capture of Delhi"
    summary="Company forces seize Delhi."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1806"
    title="Vellore uprising"
    summary="Sepoys revolt in Vellore."
  />
  <TimelinePoint
    date="1814"
    title="Gurkha War"
    summary="Gurkha forces confront the Company."
  />
</Timeline>
```
