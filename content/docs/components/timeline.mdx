# Timeline

`<Timeline>` renders a vertical, scrollable series of `<TimelinePoint>` markers that stay in
proportion to the range you provide. Each point supports a title, summary, full description, a
highlight state, and a list of IIIF resources that readers can open for deeper context.

Ranges accept year-, month-, or day-level precision (for example `1701`, `July 1776`, or
`1776-07-04`). When you pass a `range` prop to the timeline the points are spaced mathematically so a
cluster of events will appear closer together inside the scroll container.

Control the vertical track with the `height` prop. Pass a number (interpreted as pixels) or any valid
CSS size like `48rem`, `75vh`, or `60%` and the scroll container honors that value.

## Example: Two centuries of listening experiments

Below is a simple demo with eight points stretched from 1650 through 1850. The `range` prop keeps the
events proportional, the highlighted `First public ear trumpets` entry calls attention to a key moment,
and the cluster of late-18th century experiments uses `threshold={15}` so entries that fall within 15 years
of each other collapse into an expandable group.

Use the `referencedManifests` prop whenever a point should cite a work from your collection. Add every
referenced ID to the page’s `referencedManifests` front matter so Canopy can fetch the data during the
build. Pass an array (even for a single work) and the Timeline renders the same Teaser cards used in
the search modal, so each reference inherits thumbnails and metadata.

The vertical spine runs through the center of the layout. By default, each `<TimelinePoint>`
oscillates left and right of that line while a connector “arm” points back to the center marker. To
pin a point to a specific side pass `side="left"` (or `"right"`).

Set the `threshold` prop to collapse points that fall within the specified number of units for the
current `granularity`. For example, `threshold={15}` on a year-based range turns any cluster of
events that fall within 15 years into a single inline group with a “Show details” toggle.

Use `steps={50}` (or any positive number) to draw subtle tick marks along the spine. The label next to
each tick shows the computed year, so `steps={50}` on a 1650–1850 range renders marks at 1700, 1750,
1800, and so on.

Because `<TimelinePoint>` is exported globally you can nest it under `<Timeline>` without importing
anything in MDX:
