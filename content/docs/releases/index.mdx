# Releases

Every published version from `1.0.0` onward gets a short summary so builders know what changed between semantic versions. Run `npm run version:packages` when preparing a release and follow the prompts to add highlights—the helper script keeps the log below in sync.

{(!releases || releases.length === 0) ? (
  <p>Release notes will appear here after the first entry is recorded. Use `npm run version:packages` to add version highlights.</p>
) : (
  releases.map((release) => (
    <section key={release.version} className="canopy-release-entry">
      <h2>{release.version} — {release.date}</h2>
      {release.summary ? <p>{release.summary}</p> : null}
      {(release.highlights && release.highlights.length) ? (
        <ul>
          {release.highlights.map((item, index) => (
            <li key={`${release.version}-item-${index}`}>{item}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : null}
    </section>
  ))
)}

<p className="text-sm text-slate-500">The release helper stores entries in `content/docs/releases/releases.json` and exports them to `releases.data.mjs`. Manual edits are rarely necessary—rerun the script if you need to replace the latest notes.</p>
