## What is Canopy IIIF?

Canopy helps researchers, libraries, archives, and museums create **polished digital projects** with intuitive tools that showcase [IIIF](https://iiif.io) resources. It lets scholars and digital humanists curate works from many sources and add _context and narrative_. Built on IIIF’s decentralized and interoperable APIs, Canopy provides a customizable modern front end that needs no backend or database, allowing quick setup and low maintenance. The only requirement is access to [IIIF Collections](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#51-collection) with the desired objects. In minutes, users can generate **_fast, lightweight static sites_** that are easy to host and draw on IIIF’s rich metadata and media.
