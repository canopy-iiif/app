## What is Canopy IIIF?

Canopy _“makes easy”_ the creation of digital exhibits for libraries, archives, &amp; museums by providing user-experience focused components that bring IIIF resources to life. For digital humanists and scholars, Canopy provides a straightforward method to curate works from multiple sources and provide additional perspectives and aboutness beyond the included descriptive metadata. The decentralized, interoperable, and linked-data attributes of the IIIF APIs empower Canopy to provide smaller institutions with a streamlined front-end platform, neatly sidestepping the monolithic complexities often associated with conventional digital asset management systems.
