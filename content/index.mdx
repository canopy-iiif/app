## What is Canopy?

Canopy helps researchers, libraries, archives, and museums create polished digital projects with intuitive tools that showcase [IIIF](https://iiif.io) resources. It lets scholars and digital humanists curate works from many sources and add _context and narrative_. Built on IIIF’s decentralized and interoperable APIs, Canopy provides a customizable modern front end that needs no backend or database, allowing quick setup and low maintenance. The only requirement is access to [IIIF Collections](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#51-collection) with the desired objects. In minutes, users can generate **_fast, lightweight static sites_** that are easy to host and draw on IIIF’s rich metadata and media.

- Builds a **static web site** directly from IIIF Collections.
- Generates a _work_ page representing each IIIF Manifest.
- Indexes Manifest metadata automatically for search and filtering
- Provides clear, reusable IIIF-based components for presentation.
- Supports Markdown authoring for _contextual and scholarly writing_.
- Runs entirely without an integrated database or backend.
- Produces fast, lightweight, low-maintenance sites that are easy to host.
