# About This Site

This template ships with only a few baseline pages. Use it as a reference point for your own structure and content.

- Add new directories under `content/` to organize sections.
- Create `_layout.mdx` files when you need section-wide wrappers or metadata defaults.
- Bring in Canopy UI components from `@canopy-iiif/app/ui` whenever you want interactive experiences.
