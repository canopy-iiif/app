# Welcome to Canopy IIIF

This starter keeps things simple so you can focus on your collection.

- Update `canopy.yml` with the IIIF collection you want to publish.
- Author pages inside the `content/` directory using MDX.
- Run `npm run dev` to preview changes and `npm run build` to publish static files in `site/`.

Need guidance? The getting started guide at https://canopy-iiif.github.io/docs/getting-started/ walks through every step.
