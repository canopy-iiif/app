# Canopy Template

This repository offers a trimmed down starting point for new Canopy IIIF projects. When you need deeper documentation, examples, or release notes, vist the main project at https://canopy-iiif.github.io/app/.

## Getting Started

Point `canopy.yml` at your preferred IIIF collection, add pages and layouts under `content/`, and walk through the [Quick Start guide](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/app/docs/user-guides/canopy-get-started.html) to stand up your new canopy project.

## Updates

Keep your project current by running `npm install @canopy-iiif/app@latest` whenever a new release ships, or trigger the `Update Canopy App` GitHub Action (Actions tab → _Update Canopy App_ → _Run workflow_) and let it open a pull request with the dependency bump for you.

## Contributing

All development happens in https://github.com/canopy-iiif/app. If you are interested in shaping Canopy IIIF, please open an issue, share feedback, or send a pull request. Read the [Developer documentation](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/app/docs/developers) for more information.

## License

Open source in every sense, Canopy IIIF (Canopy) is an open-source project by Mat Jordan, released under the MIT License. Anyone may adapt its features and deploy digital projects without restriction. Canopy follows the principles of the open web: its source code is transparent, and its implementations are static and portable. It runs on any server or service that delivers simple files read directly by web browsers. By working directly with IIIF references—rather than creating derivative media or metadata—Canopy keeps materials with the libraries, museums, and archives that serve them, along with their descriptions, rights statements, and terms of use. Implementers should be aware of the rights and terms governing the materials they publish and deploy to the web using Canopy.
